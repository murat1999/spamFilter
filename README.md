# Imporvements and Adjustments

1. Could have made the function to check all the URLs in the url for spam checking, meaning if www.a.com has 100 links and it is not redirected, I think those 100 links should be checked for spam detection, and if redirectionDepth is more enough and those 100 links does not contain spam links, then each link from those 100 links should be checked but it will take more time
2. I did not have time to implement Extra Specification, but I would have done if I had more time
3. The link https://lab.github.com/ is not exist in the https://github.com/ HTML body, as it is https://skills.github.com/ now. (So, I assume that https://skills.github.com/ is the spam link)
